             The Some Congestion Experienced ECN Codepoint
                        draft-morton-taht-SCE-00

Abstract

   This memo reclassifies ECT(1) to be an early notification of
   congestion on ECT(0) marked packets, which can be used by AQM
   algorithms and transports as an earlier signal of congestion than CE.
   It is a simple, transparent, and backward compatible upgrade to
   existing IETF-approved AQMs, [RFC3138], and nearly all congestion
   control algorithms.

1.  Terminology

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   This memo reclassifies ECT(1) to be an early notification of
   congestion on ECT(0) marked packets, which can be used by AQM
   algorithms and transports as an earlier signal of congestion than CE
   ("Congestion Experienced").

   This memo limits its scope to the redefinition of the ECT(1)
   codepoint as SCE, "Some Congestion Experienced", with few brief
   illustrations of how it may be used.

3.  Background

   [RFC3168] defines the lower two bits of the (former) TOS byte in the
   IPv4/6 header as the ECN field.  This may take four values: Not-ECT,
   ECT(0), ECT(1) or CE.

    00     Not-ECT (Not ECN-Capable Transport)     [RFC 3168]
    01     ECT(1) (ECN-Capable Transport(1))       [RFC 3168]
    10     ECT(0) (ECN-Capable Transport(0))       [RFC 3168]
    11     CE (Congestion Experienced)             [RFC 3168]

   Research has shown that the ECT(1) codepoint goes essentially unused,
   with the "Nonce Sum" extension to ECN having not been implemented in
   practice and subsequently obsoleted by [RFC8311].  Additionally,
   known [RFC3168]-compliant senders do not emit ECT(1), and compliant
   middleboxes do not alter the field to ECT(1), while compliant
   receivers all interpret ECT(1) identically to ECT(0).  These are
   useful properties which represent an opportunity for improvement.

   Experience gained with 7 years of [RFC8290] deployment in the field
   suggests that it remains difficult to maintain the desired 100% link
   utilisation, whilst simultaneously strictly minimising induced delay
   due to excess queue depth - irrespective of whether ECN is in use.
   This leads to a reluctance amongst hardware vendors to implement the
   most effective AQM schemes because their headline benchmarks are
   throughput-based.

   The underlying cause is the very sharp "multiplicative decrease"
   reaction required of transport protocols to congestion signalling
   (whether that be packet loss or CE marks), which tends to leave the
   congestion window significantly smaller than the ideal BDP when
   triggered at only slightly above the ideal value.  The availability
   of this sharp response is required to assure network stability (AIMD
   principle), but there is presently no standardised and backwards-
   compatible means of providing a less drastic signal.

4.  Some Congestion Experienced

   As consensus has arisen that some form of ECN signaling should be an
   earlier signal than drop, this Internet Draft changes the meaning of
   ECT(1) to be SCE, meaning "Some Congestion Experienced".  The above
   ECN-field codepoint table then becomes:

    11     CE (Congestion Experienced)             [@RFC3168]

   This permits middleboxes implementing AQM to signal incipient
   congestion, below the threshold required to justify setting CE, by

   converting some proportion of ECT codepoints to SCE ("SCE marking").
   Existing [RFC3168] compliant receivers MUST transparently ignore this
   new signal, and existing middleboxes MUST still be able to convert
   SCE to CE as they presently do for ECT, thus ensuring backwards
   compatibility.

   Additionally, SCE-aware middleboxes MUST still produce CE markings as
   at present, retaining current behavior with [RFC3168] ECN endpoints.

   Permitted ECN codepoint packet transitions by middleboxes are:

           Not-ECT ->   Not-ECT or DROP
           ECT     ->   ECT or SCE or CE or DROP
           SCE     ->   SCE or CE or DROP
           CE      ->   CE or DROP

   In other words, for ECN-aware flows, the ECN marking of an individual
   packet MAY be increased by a middlebox to signal congestion, but MUST
   NOT be decreased, and packets MUST NOT be altered to appear to be
   ECN-aware if they were not originally, nor vice versa.  Note however
   that SCE is numerically less than ECT, but semantically greater, and
   the latter definition applies for this rule.

   New SCE-aware receivers and transport protocols must continue to
   apply the [RFC3168] interpretation of the CE codepoint, that is, to
   signal the sender to back off send rate to the same extent as if a
   packet loss were detected.  This maintains compatibility with
   existing middleboxes, senders and receivers.

   New SCE-aware receivers and transport protocols should interpret the
   SCE codepoint as an indication of mild congestion, with the relative
   incidence of ECT and SCE codepoints received indicating the relative
   severity of such congestion, and respond accordingly by applying send
   rates intermediate between those resulting from a continuous sequence
   of ECT codepoints, and those resulting from a CE codepoint.

   Details of how to implement SCE awareness at the transport layer will
   be left to additional Internet Drafts yet to be submitted.

   To maximise the benefit of SCE, middleboxes MUST be capable of
   producing SCE markings earlier than they presently produce CE
   markings.

5.1.  Cubic

   Consider a TCP transport implementing CUBIC congestion control.  This
   presently exhibits exponential cwnd growth during slow-start,
   polynomial cwnd growth in steady-state, and multiplicative decrease
   upon detecting a single CE marking or packet loss in one RTT cycle.

   With SCE awareness, it might exit slow-start upon detecting a single
   SCE marking, switch from polynomial to Reno-linear cwnd growth when
   the SCE:ECT ratio exceeds 1:2, halt cwnd growth entirely when it
   exceeds 1:1, and implement a Reno-linear decline when it exceeds 2:1,
   in addition to retaining the sharp 40% decrease on detecting CE.  In
   ideal circumstances, this would result in the cwnd stabilising at a
   level which produces between 50% and 66% SCE marking at some
   bottleneck on the path.

5.2.  TCP receiver side handling

   SCE can potentially be handled entirely by the receiver and be
   entirely independent of any of the dozens of [RFC3168] compliant
   congestion control algorithms.

   A SCE TCP aware receiver MAY (based on a setsockopt option) choose to
   interpret SCE markings as CE and send ECE notifications back to the
   sender based on the ratio of markings, and/or variations in TCP
   timestamps.

   A TCP receiver desiring low latency SHOULD respond with ECE signals
   earlier, one desiring higher bandwidth, later.

   Alternatively, a SCE aware reciever can attempt to infer what
   congestion control is being used on the sender side of the
   connection.

5.3.  Other

   New transports under development such as QUIC SHOULD implement a
   multi-bit and finer grained signal back to the sender based on SCE.
