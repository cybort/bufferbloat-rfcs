                  The Some Congestion Experienced Bit
                        draft-morton-taht-SCE-00

Abstract

   This memo reclassifies ECT(0) to be an early notification of
   congestion on ECT(1) marked packets, which can be used by AQM
   algorithms and transports as an earlier signal of congestion than CE.
   It is transparent, backward compatible upgrade to existing and future
   IETF-approved AQM algorithms.

1.  Terminology

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   [RFC3168] defines the lower two bits of the (former) TOS byte in the
   IPv4/6 header as the ECN field.  This may take four values: Not-ECT,
   ECT(0), ECT(1) or CE.  To quote:

   IPv4 TOS Byte and IPv6 Traffic Class Octet

   Description: The registrations are identical for IPv4 and IPv6.

    00     Not-ECT (Not ECN-Capable Transport)     [RFC 3168]
    01     ECT(1) (ECN-Capable Transport(1))       [RFC 3168]
    10     ECT(0) (ECN-Capable Transport(0))       [RFC 3168]
    11     CE (Congestion Experienced)             [RFC 3168]

   Presently however, the ECT(1) codepoint goes essentially unused, with
   the Nonce Sum extension to ECN having not been implemented in
   practice (and now considered unnecessary and obsolete).  RFC-
   compliant senders do not emit ECT(1), and RFC-compliant middleboxes
   do not alter the field to ECT(1), while RFC-compliant receivers
   interpret ECT(1) identically to ECT(0).  These are useful properties
   which represent an opportunity for improvement.

   Meanwhile, experience gained with AQM in the field suggests that it
   is difficult to maintain the desired 100% link utilisation, whilst
   simultaneously strictly minimising induced delay due to excess queue
   depth - irrespective of whether ECN is in use.  This leads to a
   reluctance amongst hardware vendors to implement the most effective
   AQM schemes because their headline benchmarks are throughput-based.

   The underlying cause is the very sharp "multiplicative decrease"
   reaction required of transport protocols to congestion signalling
   (whether that be packet loss or CE marks), which tends to leave the
   congestion window significantly smaller than the ideal BDP when
   triggered at only slightly above the ideal value.  The availability
   of this sharp response is required to assure network stability (AIMD
   principle), but there is presently no standardised and backwards-
   compatible means of providing a less drastic signal.

   Given the confluence of these circumstances, we propose as a solution
   the redefinition of ECT(1) as SCE, meaning "Some Congestion
   Experienced".  The above ECN-field codepoint table would then become:

    00     Not-ECT (Not ECN-Capable Transport)     [@RFC3168]
    01     SCE (Some Congestion Experienced)       [This Internet-draft]
    10     ECT (ECN-Capable Transport)             [@RFC3168]
    11     CE (Congestion Experienced)             [@RFC3168]

   This permits middleboxes implementing AQM to signal incipient
   congestion, below the threshold required to justify setting CE, by
   converting some proportion of ECT codepoints to SCE ("SCE marking").
   Existing receivers transparently ignore this new signal, and existing
   middleboxes will still be able to convert SCE to CE as they presently
   do for ECT, thus ensuring backwards compatibility.  Additionally,

   SCE-aware middleboxes will still produce CE markings as at present,
   retaining current behaviour with Classic ECN endpoints.

   Permitted ECN codepoint packet transitions by middleboxes:

   Not-ECT -> Not-ECT or DROP ECT -> ECT or SCE or CE or DROP SCE -> SCE
   or CE or DROP CE -> CE or DROP

   In other words, for ECN-aware flows, the ECN marking of an individual
   packet MAY be increased by a middlebox to signal congestion, but MUST
   NOT be decreased, and packets MUST NOT be altered to appear to be
   ECN-aware if they were not originally, nor vice versa.  Note however
   that SCE is numerically less than ECT, but semantically greater, and
   the latter definition applies for this rule.

   SCE-aware receivers and transport protocols must continue to apply
   the [RFC3168] interpretation of the CE codepoint, that is, to signal
   the sender to back off send rate to the same extent as if a packet
   loss were detected.  This maintains compatibility with existing
   middleboxes.

   SCE-aware receivers and transport protocols should interpret the SCE
   codepoint as an indication of mild congestion, with the relative
   incidence of ECT and SCE codepoints received indicating the relative
   severity of such congestion, and respond accordingly by applying send
   rates intermediate between those resulting from a continuous sequence
   of ECT codepoints, and those resulting from a CE codepoint.

   As a concrete example, consider a TCP transport implementing CUBIC
   congestion control.  This presently exhibits exponential cwnd growth
   during slow-start, polynomial cwnd growth in steady-state, and
   multiplicative decrease (by 40%) upon detecting a single CE marking
   or packet loss in one RTT cycle.  With SCE awareness, it might exit
   slow-start upon detecting a single SCE marking, switch from
   polynomial to Reno-linear cwnd growth when the SCE:ECT ratio exceeds
   1:2, halt cwnd growth entirely when it exceeds 1:1, and implement a
   Reno-linear decline when it exceeds 2:1, in addition to retaining the
   sharp 40% decrease on detecting CE.  In ideal circumstances, this
   would result in the cwnd stabilising at a level which produces
   between 50% and 66% SCE marking at some bottleneck on the path.

   Details of how to implement SCE awareness at the transport layer will
   be left to a separate proposal in the ELR series.

   To maximise the benefit of SCE, middleboxes should be capable of
   producing SCE markings considerably earlier than they presently
   produce CE markings.  In particular, the ideal moment to signal the
   exit of TCP slow-start (which typically doubles the cwnd per RTT) is

   when the throughput of the flow reaches 50% of the bandwidth
   available for it.  At this point, however, traditional AQM
   implementations see only an empty queue and take no signalling
   action.

   This is also a matter deserving more detailed attention in a separate
   proposal in the ELR series.

   This document therefore limits its scope to proposing the
   redefinition of the ECT(1) codepoint as SCE, with some brief
   illustrations of how it may be used.
