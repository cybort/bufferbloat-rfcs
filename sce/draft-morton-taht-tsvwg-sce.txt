             The Some Congestion Experienced ECN Codepoint
                     draft-morton-taht-tsvwg-sce-00

Abstract

   This memo reclassifies ECT(1) to be an early notification of
   congestion on ECT(0) marked packets, which can be used by AQM
   algorithms and transports as an earlier signal of congestion than CE.
   It is a simple, transparent, and backward compatible upgrade to
   existing IETF-approved AQMs, RFC3168, and nearly all congestion
   control algorithms.

1.  Terminology

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   This memo reclassifies ECT(1) to be an early notification of
   congestion on ECT(0) marked packets, which can be used by AQM
   algorithms and transports as an earlier signal of congestion than CE
   ("Congestion Experienced").

   This memo limits its scope to the redefinition of the ECT(1)
   codepoint as SCE, "Some Congestion Experienced", with a few brief
   illustrations of how it may be used.

3.  Background

   [RFC3168] defines the lower two bits of the (former) TOS byte in the
   IPv4/6 header as the ECN field.  This may take four values: Not-ECT,
   ECT(0), ECT(1) or CE.

    01     ECT(1) (ECN-Capable Transport(1))       [RFC 3168]

    11     CE (Congestion Experienced)             [RFC 3168]

   Research has shown that the ECT(1) codepoint goes essentially unused,
   with the "Nonce Sum" extension to ECN having not been implemented in
   practice and thus subsequently obsoleted by [RFC8311] (section 3).
   Additionally, known [RFC3168] compliant senders do not emit ECT(1),
   and compliant middleboxes do not alter the field to ECT(1), while
   compliant receivers all interpret ECT(1) identically to ECT(0).
   These are useful properties which represent an opportunity for
   improvement.

   Experience gained with 7 years of [RFC8290] deployment in the field
   suggests that it remains difficult to maintain the desired 100% link
   utilisation, whilst simultaneously strictly minimising induced delay
   due to excess queue depth - irrespective of whether ECN is in use.
   This leads to a reluctance amongst hardware vendors to implement the
   most effective AQM schemes because their headline benchmarks are
   throughput-based.

   The underlying cause is the very sharp "multiplicative decrease"
   reaction required of transport protocols to congestion signalling
   (whether that be packet loss or CE marks), which tends to leave the
   congestion window significantly smaller than the ideal BDP when
   triggered at only slightly above the ideal value.  The availability
   of this sharp response is required to assure network stability (AIMD
   principle), but there is presently no standardised and backwards-
   compatible means of providing a less drastic signal.

4.  Some Congestion Experienced

   As consensus has arisen that some form of ECN signaling should be an
   earlier signal than drop, this Internet Draft changes the meaning of
   ECT(1) to be SCE, meaning "Some Congestion Experienced".  The above
   ECN-field codepoint table then becomes:

    00     Not-ECT (Not ECN-Capable Transport)     [@RFC3168]
    01     SCE (Some Congestion Experienced)       [This Internet-draft]
    10     ECT (ECN-Capable Transport)             [@RFC3168]
    11     CE (Congestion Experienced)             [@RFC3168]

   This permits middleboxes implementing AQM to signal incipient
   congestion, below the threshold required to justify setting CE, by
   converting some proportion of ECT codepoints to SCE ("SCE marking").
   Existing [RFC3168] compliant receivers MUST transparently ignore this
   new signal with respect to congestion control, and both existing and
   SCE-aware middleboxes MAY convert SCE to CE in the same circumstances
   as for ECT, thus ensuring backwards compatibility with [RFC3168] ECN
   endpoints.

   Permitted ECN codepoint packet transitions by middleboxes are:

           Not-ECT ->   Not-ECT or DROP
           ECT     ->   ECT or SCE or CE or DROP
           SCE     ->   SCE or CE or DROP
           CE      ->   CE or DROP

   In other words, for ECN-aware flows, the ECN marking of an individual
   packet MAY be increased by a middlebox to signal congestion, but MUST
   NOT be decreased, and packets SHALL NOT be altered to appear to be
   ECN-aware if they were not originally, nor vice versa.  Note however
   that SCE is numerically less than ECT, but semantically greater, and
   the latter definition applies for this rule.

   New SCE-aware receivers and transport protocols SHALL continue to
   apply the [RFC3168] interpretation of the CE codepoint, that is, to
   signal the sender to back off send rate to the same extent as if a
   packet loss were detected.  This maintains compatibility with
   existing middleboxes, senders and receivers.

   New SCE-aware receivers and transport protocols SHOULD interpret the
   SCE codepoint as an indication of mild congestion, and respond
   accordingly by applying send rates intermediate between those
   resulting from a continuous sequence of ECT codepoints, and those
   resulting from a CE codepoint.  The ratio of ECT and SCE codepoints
   received indicates the relative severity of such congestion, such
   that 100% SCE is very close to the threshold of CE marking, 100% ECT
   indicates that the bottleneck link may not be fully utilised, and
   some mixture of ECT and SCE codepoints indicates that the present
   send rate is a good match to the bottleneck link.

   Details of how to implement SCE awareness at the transport layer will
   be left to additional Internet Drafts yet to be submitted.  To ensure
   RTT-fair convergence with single-queue SCE AQMs, transports SHOULD

   stabilise at higher SCE ratios for higher BDPs, and MAY reduce their
   response to CE marks IFF they are responding to SCE signals received
   at around the same time (eg. in adjacent packets, or at least during
   the same RTT) in the same flow.

   To maximise the benefit of SCE, middleboxes SHOULD produce SCE
   markings sooner than they produce CE markings, when the level of
   congestion increases.

5.  Examples of use

5.1.  TCP Fast Open

   If the three-way handshake is conducted using ECT-marked packets, it
   would become feasible to detect a congested link on the path before
   slow-start even begins, and pre-emptively disable behaviour which
   would likely exacerbate that congestion.  In particular, senders
   should consider choosing a smaller Initial Window and/or going
   straight into Congestion Avoidance mode instead of Slow Start, if SCE
   or CE is signalled during the handshake.

   Since ECE is already set for the SYN/ACK packet as part of ECN
   negotiation, other means must be used to convey reception of a CE
   mark on the SYN packet.  This could take the form of a small initial
   Receive Window, the NS bit additionally being set, or the provision
   of an explicit ECN feedback option if the SYN endpoint indicated
   support.

5.2.  Cubic

   Consider a TCP transport implementing a CUBIC-like congestion
   control.  This presently exhibits exponential cwnd growth during
   slow-start, polynomial cwnd growth in steady-state, and
   multiplicative decrease upon detecting a single CE marking or packet
   loss in one RTT cycle.

   With SCE awareness, it might exit slow-start upon detecting a single
   SCE marking, reduce the slope of its growth function slightly for
   each SCE mark received, and implement a square-root decline using a
   variant of the Reno-linear formula when growth is essentially halted
   by high enough SCE rates.  On detecting CE in isolation, the existing
   30% or 40% sharp reduction is retained, but a smaller 10% or 20%
   reduction might be implemented when CE is accompanied by SCE to
   retain overall throughput in competition with SCE-ignorant flows.

   In ideal circumstances, the above behaviour would result in the send
   rate stabilising at a level which produces SCE marking but not CE
   marking at some bottleneck on the path.  The middlebox performing

   this marking can thus control the send rate smoothly to an ideal
   value, maximising throughput with minimum average queue length.

5.3.  TCP receiver side handling

   SCE can potentially be handled entirely by the receiver, and thus be
   entirely independent of any of the dozens of [RFC3168] compliant
   congestion control algorithms on the sender side.

   Alternatively, some mechanism may be defined to feed back SCE signals
   to the sender explicitly.  Details of this are left to future I-Ds
   covering TCP in detail; use could be made of the redundant NS bit in
   the TCP header.

5.4.  Other

   New transports under development such as QUIC SHOULD implement a
   multi-bit, sub-RTT, and finer grained signal back to the sender based
   on SCE.

7.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.

8.  Security Considerations

   An adversary could inappropriately set SCE marks at middleboxes he
   controls to slow down SCE-aware flows, eventually reaching a minimum
   congestion window.  However, the same threat already exists with
   respect to inappropriately setting CE marks on normal ECN flows, and
   this would have a greater impact per mark.  Therefore no new threat
   is exposed by SCE in practice.

   An adversary could also simply ignore SCE marks at the receiver, or
   ignore SCE information fed back from the receiver to the sender, in
   an attempt to gain some advantage in throughput.  Again, the same
   could be said about ignoring CE marks, so no truly new threat is
   exposed.  Additionally, correctly implemented SCE detection may
   actually improve long-term goodput compared to ignoring SCE.

   An adversary could erase congestion information by converting SCE
   marks to ECT or Not-ECT codepoints, thus hiding it from the receiver.
   This has equivalent effects to ignoring SCE signals at the receiver.
   An identical threat already exists for erasing congestion information

   from CE marked packets, and may be mitigated by AQMs switching to
   dropping packets from flows observed to be non-responsive to CE.
