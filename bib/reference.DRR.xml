(FIXME need IEEE/ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING VOL 4, NO. 3 in here somehow above), and Member, IEEE
Fair Queuing is a technique that allows each flow passing through a network device to have a fair share of network resources. Previous schemes for fair queueinng that achieved nearly perfect fairness were expensive to implement; specificly the work required to process a packet in these schemes was O(log(n)) where n is the number of active flows.

<t>
Deficit Round Robin achieves near perfect fairness, requires only O(1) work to process a packet and is simple enough to implement in hardware.
