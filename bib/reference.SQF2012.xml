We present a packet scheduler called “shortest
queue first” (SQF) that aims at protecting audio and video traffic from the congestion caused by data traffic. Unlike standard
solutions, the services to be handled with priority are
not known in advance. It is rather the traffic characteristics of audio and
video applications that are used to detect their delay sensitivity.
The SQF algorithm does not require any prior configuration
of the network and, as such, adapts to the fast evolution of
traffic and usage. The performance of the proposed solution is
demonstrated using both analysis and experiments on a testbed
emulating a residential access line
